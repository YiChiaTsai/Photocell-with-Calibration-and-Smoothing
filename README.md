# Photocell-with-Calibration-and-Smoothing
Scenario: Automatically turn on/off the lights in EC building depending on the room light level.

Use photocell sensor to design a LED switch.
– Turn on the LED, if it is dark
– Turn off the LED, otherwise

PS: Calibration () and Smoothing () should be used in the lab.
Hint: you may refer to the circuit in lab 3.

Try to combine Calibration and Smoothing.
– Step one: Write Smoothing as a function and add
the Smoothing() into Lab 3.
– Step two: Write Calibration as a function
Calibration () as well.
PS: Calibration () and Smoothing () will be used in
the future labs.
